  We propose ESGNN, the first method to use Equivariant Graph Neural Networks for semantic scene graph generation from 3D point clouds. By preserving geometric symmetries, ESGNN achieves superior accuracy, faster convergence, and lower computational cost, making it well-suited for real-time applications in robotics and computer vision.
